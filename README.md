# Metronomek
Metronome with trivial look but pure sound and sophisticated possibilities

Main goal is to have natural "analogue" metronome sound
and loud enaough for modile devices.

So yes, it is crossplatform due to it uses Qt framework.

Also there is a plan to make it programable,
means how long given tempo is ticking
then smooth tempo changes during desired period of time.
