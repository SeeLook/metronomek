# TODO list for MetronomeK

 - musical tempo names (Italian ones) - nicely animated
 - a few sounds more
 - configuration for programming tempo change:
   - event after tempo is changed (time, bar/beats number, click/touch)
   - target tempo
 - storing set of tempo changes (piece) into XML structure
 - [Android] disable/enable screen rotation
 - icons to menu
 - skins: classic, digital, contemporary and that trivial of course remains
