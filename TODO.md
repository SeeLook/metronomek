# TODO list for MetronomeK

 - configuration for programming tempo change:
   - event after tempo is changed (time, bar/beats number, click/touch)
   - target tempo
   - storing set of tempo changes (piece) into XML structure
 - fit metronome image colors to current system palette
 - dark mode (Android for sure, maybe desktop)
 - option for blinking of background during tick
 - icons for menu
 - skins: classic, digital, contemporary and that trivial of course remains
 - maybe a few sounds more
