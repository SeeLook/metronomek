# TODO list for MetronomeK

 - sounds and option for verbal counting
 - save/load rhythmic composition to/from file system
 - option for playing beat/ring in separate speaker/earphone of stereo output
 - dark mode (Android for sure, maybe desktop)
 - option for blinking of background during tick
 - icons for menu
 - skins: classic, digital, contemporary and that trivial of course remains
 - maybe a few sounds more, i.e. digital, high pitched

### KNOWING ISSUES:

 - \[Android\] incoming call locks sound but doesn't lock pendulum = not synchronized move and sound
 - some sounds are simply not acceptable - remove them (after some pool)
