# TODO list for MetronomeK

 - configuration for programming tempo change:
   - event after tempo will be changed (time, bar/beats number, click/touch)
   - target tempo
   - allow acceleration and slowing down
   - storing set of tempo changes (piece) into XML structure
 - sounds and option for verbal counting
 - option for playing beat/ring in separate speaker/earphone of stereo output
 - dark mode (Android for sure, maybe desktop)
 - option for blinking of background during tick
 - icons for menu
 - skins: classic, digital, contemporary and that trivial of course remains
 - maybe a few sounds more, i.e. digital, high pitched

### KNOWING ISSUES:

 - \[Android\] incoming call locks sound but doesn't lock pendulum = not synchronized move and sound
 - some sounds are simply not acceptable - remove them (after some pool)
